# Solid Principles
1) **Single responsibility**

Classes and methods should be responsible only for single thing and that ensures that they 
can be reused much easier later on

2) **Open closed**

The code should be open for extensions so that we should be able to extend an existing code with 
functionality but closed for modifications, we shouldn't need to modify the original code in order to do that

3) **Liskov substitution**

It means that if you have objects in a program you should be able to replace those objects with instances
of their subtypes or subclasses without altering the correctness of the program

4) **Interface segregation**

It's better to have several specific interfaces as opposed to one general interface.

5) **Dependency Inversion**

Classes should depends on abstractions and not on concrete subclasses.
